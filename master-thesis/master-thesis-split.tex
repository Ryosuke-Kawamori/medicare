\abstract{%
This article proposes how to find fraudulent activities from data of healthcare claim in an unsupervised way. Firstly, we split data into homogenous groups by providers'{}
department, number of speciality, and their geographical location, otherwise we may find providers doing rare operations or providers in rural areas because of its lower submitted money than in urban areas.
Next, we apply outlier detection method, One-SVM and LOF to that groups. We find variation due to department and geographical location. Finally, we evaluate the effectiveness by labels of providers who are excluded
because of their having committed fraud. Proposed method is above random and may be used as a first line of further investigation.
